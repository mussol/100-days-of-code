# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

Revisited my tribute page to Antoni Gaudi and moved it to GitHub from CodePen (had to learn how to as well!).

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

Worked on FCC challenges, refreshing knowledge on HTML and CSS before tackling a revision of my tribute page and the design of my portfolio.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

Revised my tribute page.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

Starting to design my portfolio from scratch. Difficult to start, but resolved to at least build a skeleton for now (no work to show for now!)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

Happy with the work accomplished today with my portfolio. Published first draft skeleton in GitHub. Using only what've learned for now in FCC: HTML, CSS; Bootstrap, font-awesome icons.

### Day 6, January 7, 2017

Continued working on my portfolio. Not such a good day though: getting stuck on the details of the functionalities of CSS/Bootstrap (alignments, paddings/margins, bugs on font-awesome icons,... basics?)
