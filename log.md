# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

Revisited my tribute page to Antoni Gaudi and moved it to GitHub from CodePen (had to learn how to as well!).

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

Worked on FCC (FreeCodeCamp) challenges, refreshing knowledge on HTML and CSS before tackling a revision of my tribute page and the design of my portfolio.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

Revised my tribute page.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

Starting to design my portfolio from scratch. Difficult to start, but resolved to at least build a skeleton for now (no work to show for now!)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

Happy with the work accomplished today with my portfolio. Published first draft skeleton in GitHub. Using only what've learned for now in FCC: HTML, CSS; Bootstrap, font-awesome icons.

### Day 6, January 7, 2017

Continued working on my portfolio. Not such a good day though: getting stuck on the details of the functionalities of CSS/Bootstrap (alignments, paddings/margins, bugs on font-awesome icons,... basics?). There's a difference between what I created and see on codepen and what shows in github pages, need to find why.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

Read a lot today. Articles, tutorials... found a series of exercises to practice CSS selectors, which was mostly new to me, interactive and entertaining, helped a lot. Should find more ressources for other features to practice. Found some possibilities while browsing and will most probably look into them tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

Did some learning today from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) tutorials on HTML and CSS. I feel my basis is finally more solid so I'm more confident. Have made some changes to my portfolio page while going through all features and updated the github code. Tomorrow will finish tutorial on CSS and search for final solution to small unresolved issues with the site.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

Learned some more CSS from MDN, tried several things to fix my portfolio page without much success for now..

### Day 10: January 11, 2017

Uploaded to github the latest version of my portfolio. Have worked on it a bit more today and this'll be my last draft version for now. I'll make a pause to resume learning in FCC about JavaScript now so I can move on to other projects. Will be coming back to the portfolio in the future (will also need to add all the images, that for now are only placeholders).
Overall, this portfolio has proven to be quite a humbling experience, HTML/CSS are not as easy as I first assumed, or perhaps I took an overly complicated route when it could have been simpler from the start, who knows. Will be interesting to see what kind of portfolio I end up having in a couple of months.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

Before diving into the next lessons in FCC (JavaScript), took a break to work with some Python in CS212 course in Udacity (Design of Computer Programs). Today worked through some lessons only so for the coding of the day I worked as well on katas in codewars

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

In CS212 course, worked on some coding for a poker game. 

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

Coding in Python. Discovered and practiced some functions within the itertools module. Finished lesson 1 in CS212. Also dove into JavaScript: went through several FCC challenges. So far it's pretty similar to Python.

### Day 14: January 16, 2017

Almost finished all basic JavaScript and OOP challenges in FCC (82 in a row! :s) before starting some algorithm scripting, looking forward to actual open exercises. JavaScrcipt is now to me between Python and, more closely, Java. Will it be easy to make small mistakes because of it since my Java is not yet fluent?

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

Quickly finished JS/OOP challenges and started the basic algorithms ie short independent exercises to solve on my own. They're quite fun and entertaining. I've seem some of them in the past so the task is more that of remembering and translating, a good exercise in another way.

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

Did quite some more basic algorithms, some quite tricky. Also visited codewars and practiced some katas in Python.

### Day 17: January 19, 2017

Again some more algorithms. Hoped to finish them all but might leave a couple for tomorrow. Should move on to the CS212 course (self-imposed deadline this sunday!). No extra time today.

### Day 18: January 20, 2017

Intense day today working with Python. Did most of lesson 2 from the CS212 course in Udacity, quite advanced coding so really inspiring, only the problem sets to finish now. Learning a lot from this course, read a bit about idioms and techniques, best practices.

### Day 19: January 21, 2017

Short day: only had time to get my mind blown by the solutions to some problems in CS212 course (I'm definitely not good enough!) and did the challenges for JSON APIs and AJAX.

### Day 20: January 22, 2017

Starting to read about, investigate and set up the Random quote machine project in FCC.
