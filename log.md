# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

Revisited my tribute page to Antoni Gaudi and moved it to GitHub from CodePen (had to learn how to as well!).

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

Worked on FCC (FreeCodeCamp) challenges, refreshing knowledge on HTML and CSS before tackling a revision of my tribute page and the design of my portfolio.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

Revised my tribute page.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

Starting to design my portfolio from scratch. Difficult to start, but resolved to at least build a skeleton for now (no work to show for now!)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

Happy with the work accomplished today with my portfolio. Published first draft skeleton in GitHub. Using only what've learned for now in FCC: HTML, CSS; Bootstrap, font-awesome icons.

### Day 6, January 7, 2017

Continued working on my portfolio. Not such a good day though: getting stuck on the details of the functionalities of CSS/Bootstrap (alignments, paddings/margins, bugs on font-awesome icons,... basics?). There's a difference between what I created and see on codepen and what shows in github pages, need to find why.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

Read a lot today. Articles, tutorials... found a series of exercises to practice CSS selectors, which was mostly new to me, interactive and entertaining, helped a lot. Should find more ressources for other features to practice. Found some possibilities while browsing and will most probably look into them tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

Did some learning today from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) tutorials on HTML and CSS. I feel my basis is finally more solid so I'm more confident. Have made some changes to my portfolio page while going through all features and updated the github code. Tomorrow will finish tutorial on CSS and search for final solution to small unresolved issues with the site.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

Learned some more CSS from MDN, tried several things to fix my portfolio page without much success for now..

### Day 10: January 11, 2017

Uploaded to github the latest version of my portfolio. Have worked on it a bit more today and this'll be my last draft version for now. I'll make a pause to resume learning in FCC about JavaScript now so I can move on to other projects. Will be coming back to the portfolio in the future (will also need to add all the images, that for now are only placeholders).
Overall, this portfolio has proven to be quite a humbling experience, HTML/CSS are not as easy as I first assumed, or perhaps I took an overly complicated route when it could have been simpler from the start, who knows. Will be interesting to see what kind of portfolio I end up having in a couple of months.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

Before diving into the next lessons in FCC (JavaScript), took a break to work with some Python in CS212 course in Udacity (Design of Computer Programs). Today worked through some lessons only so for the coding of the day I worked as well on katas in codewars

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

In CS212 course, worked on some coding for a poker game. 

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

Coding in Python. Discovered and practiced some functions within the itertools module. Finished lesson 1 in CS212. Also dove into JavaScript: went through several FCC challenges. So far it's pretty similar to Python.

### Day 14: January 16, 2017

Almost finished all basic JavaScript and OOP challenges in FCC (82 in a row! :s) before starting some algorithm scripting, looking forward to actual open exercises. JavaScrcipt is now to me between Python and, more closely, Java. Will it be easy to make small mistakes because of it since my Java is not yet fluent?

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

Quickly finished JS/OOP challenges and started the basic algorithms ie short independent exercises to solve on my own. They're quite fun and entertaining. I've seem some of them in the past so the task is more that of remembering and translating, a good exercise in another way.

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

Did quite some more basic algorithms, some quite tricky. Also visited codewars and practiced some katas in Python.

### Day 17: January 19, 2017

Again some more algorithms. Hoped to finish them all but might leave a couple for tomorrow. Should move on to the CS212 course (self-imposed deadline this sunday!). No extra time today.

### Day 18: January 20, 2017

Intense day today working with Python. Did most of lesson 2 from the CS212 course in Udacity, quite advanced coding so really inspiring, only the problem sets to finish now. Learning a lot from this course, read a bit about idioms and techniques, best practices.

### Day 19: January 21, 2017

Short day: only had time to get my mind blown by the solutions to some problems in CS212 course (I'm definitely not good enough!) and did the challenges for JSON APIs and AJAX.

### Day 20: January 22, 2017

Starting to read about, investigate and set up the Random quote machine project in FCC.

### Day 21: January 23, 2017

Built a skeleton of my randm quote site and then tried to understand APIs: what are they, how can I find one to use for free and how to make it work (and the extra challeges of codepen). Taking quite some time!

### Day 22: January 24, 2017

Trying to find a way to still use an API for the random quote page.

### Day 23: January 25, 2017

Working on the random quote page. Really getting mad because the FCC lessons didn't explain anything compared to what I'm seeing in other people's codes. Yes, I kind of gave up trying to find out by myself how it works and searched for other random quote sites to see how they're built. I noticed, surprisingly, that most of them (in codepen) don't call an API but hardcoded the quotes in a JS object. Still, difficult to see how I could have coded that with the knowledge I have of JS at this point (from FCC and random search online) - impossible.

### Day 24: February 04, 2017

Yes, I admit I took some days off... The reason is rather silly, but I actually got frustrated with my random quote project. Couldn't make the call to the API work and I still don't know why, so I got frustrated and stopped. Mistake: didn't switch to something else. Today I'm picking up again where I left off (against the rules of the challenge, I'm aware!) with some challenges in FCC. Trying the beta version with renewed curriculum and seems quite more logical, at least for the first part.

### Day 25: February 05, 2017

Started/finished the course on how to build a website from Codecademy. Trying to start again easy after the break so what's better than to consolidate bases?

### Day 26: February 06, 2017

Following the same path as yesterday, started the Codecademy course on HTML/CSS (part I), did 4 units (42%) out of 9. I find that they present concepts in a cleaner way than in FCC - maybe with the new FCC curriculum that will change? The comments seems to point there.

### Day 27: February 07, 2017

Finished course on HTML/CSS from codecademy. Definitely liked the way they organise and present the concepts. The opportunity is there to see the concepts live and play with them while learning. It was a good move that helped me clarify and organise what I knew and also expand some concepts.

### Day 28: February 08 2017

Worked on reformulating the random quote webpage. Started by using a piece of code with the JS call to API found online, which worked where mine didn't. Had spent several days trying to find out how to do but I think at this point it's beyobnd my knowledge (so far only did the challenges on FCC on API and they're way not enough, I have hopes that with the new curriculum that'll improve, or maybe we are not supposed to do very well on this project yet and ressort to hardcoding the quotes). Eitherway, my quotes page is not perfect, but works, so I'll leave it as it is for now.

### Day 29: February 09, 2017

Updating github with changes. Resumed FCC challenges: intermediate algorithm scripting.

### Day 30: February 10-12, 2017

Could not put a decent coding session in during these days, but managed to do alltogether a couple of FCC intermediate algorithms and some reading. With the idea of improving and practicing my javascript skills, I also made the decision to try the #javascript30 course by Wes Bos. Not sure what level it'll have, supposedly intermediate, but not sure I'm there yet. We'll see - signed up and will start tomorrow.

### Day 31: February 13, 2017

Started #javascript30! Mmmm It's definitely beyond my level at this point. However, I like the course, the way it's organised and taught. I am also motivated to improve, so I'll stick to it and follow the course at my own pace. Practice, practice, practice! I think though that I'll need some "lower-level" practice to alternate with (that'll help consolidate bases) so I don't burn out ;)

### Day 32: February 14, 2017

Been mainly looking at javascript resources: followed a short course/tutorial (1.5h) that ended up being too basic for me and started another longer one that is for now a good one: starts with the basics but extends to so much further, allowing me to practice in parallel. Did already some longer coding as exercises that met my daily goal. Will continue with this course in parallel to #javascript30 and FCC.

### Day 33: February 15, 2017

Practiced objects and arrays in JS, still within yesterday's course (in Udemy). I confirm it helps improving my knowledge, many small things I didn't realise come into place. Feeling positive.

### Day 34: February 20, 2017

After some days without computer and barely 20 minutes on the best of days, I managed to start/complete the JavaScript course on SoloLearn (via ipad). Last module's theory on DOM, event handlers and animations was actually new to me.

### Day 35: February 21, 2017

JavaScript30 first lesson: drum kit. Implemented step by step the vanilla JS explained during the exercise and later played a bit with the css. I understood much better the JS code now than a few days ago when I attempted it for the first time (yay!). Also learned about template literals, which I'd never used before. All in all a very fruitful day so far. Later read as well about list comprehensions, practiced filter, map and reduce functions.

### Day 36: February 22, 2017

Practiced JS arrays: forEach, slice, filter, concat, indexOf... Cracked a FCC algorithm I'd been stuck with for a while.
