# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

Revisited my tribute page to Antoni Gaudi and moved it to GitHub from CodePen (had to learn how to as well!).

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

Worked on FCC challenges, refreshing knowledge on HTML and CSS before tackling a revision of my tribute page and the design of my portfolio.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

Revised my tribute page.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

Starting to design my portfolio from scratch. Difficult to start, but resolved to at least build a skeleton for now (no work to show for now!)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

Happy with the work accomplished today with my portfolio. Published first draft skeleton in GitHub. Using only what've learned for now in FCC: HTML, CSS; Bootstrap, font-awesome icons.

### Day 6, January 7, 2017

Continued working on my portfolio. Not such a good day though: getting stuck on the details of the functionalities of CSS/Bootstrap (alignments, paddings/margins, bugs on font-awesome icons,... basics?). There's a difference between what I created and see on codepen and what shows in github pages, need to find why.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

Read a lot today. Articles, tutorials... found a series of exercises to practice CSS selectors, which was mostly new to me, interactive and entertaining, helped a lot. Should find more ressources for other features to practice. Found some possibilities while browsing and will most probably look into them tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

Did some learning today from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) tutorials on HTML and CSS. I feel my basis is finally more solid so I'm more confident. Have made some changes to my portfolio page while going through all features and updated the github code. Tomorrow will finish tutorial on CSS and search for final solution to small unresolved issues with the site.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

Learned some more CSS from MDN, tried several things to fix my portfolio page without much success for now..
