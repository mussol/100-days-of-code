# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

Revisited my tribute page to Antoni Gaudi and moved it to GitHub from CodePen (had to learn how to as well!).

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

Worked on FCC (FreeCodeCamp) challenges, refreshing knowledge on HTML and CSS before tackling a revision of my tribute page and the design of my portfolio.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

Revised my tribute page.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

Starting to design my portfolio from scratch. Difficult to start, but resolved to at least build a skeleton for now (no work to show for now!)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

Happy with the work accomplished today with my portfolio. Published first draft skeleton in GitHub. Using only what've learned for now in FCC: HTML, CSS; Bootstrap, font-awesome icons.

### Day 6, January 7, 2017

Continued working on my portfolio. Not such a good day though: getting stuck on the details of the functionalities of CSS/Bootstrap (alignments, paddings/margins, bugs on font-awesome icons,... basics?). There's a difference between what I created and see on codepen and what shows in github pages, need to find why.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

Read a lot today. Articles, tutorials... found a series of exercises to practice CSS selectors, which was mostly new to me, interactive and entertaining, helped a lot. Should find more ressources for other features to practice. Found some possibilities while browsing and will most probably look into them tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

Did some learning today from MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) tutorials on HTML and CSS. I feel my basis is finally more solid so I'm more confident. Have made some changes to my portfolio page while going through all features and updated the github code. Tomorrow will finish tutorial on CSS and search for final solution to small unresolved issues with the site.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

Learned some more CSS from MDN, tried several things to fix my portfolio page without much success for now..

### Day 10: January 11, 2017

Uploaded to github the latest version of my portfolio. Have worked on it a bit more today and this'll be my last draft version for now. I'll make a pause to resume learning in FCC about JavaScript now so I can move on to other projects. Will be coming back to the portfolio in the future (will also need to add all the images, that for now are only placeholders).
Overall, this portfolio has proven to be quite a humbling experience, HTML/CSS are not as easy as I first assumed, or perhaps I took an overly complicated route when it could have been simpler from the start, who knows. Will be interesting to see what kind of portfolio I end up having in a couple of months.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

Before diving into the next lessons in FCC (JavaScript), took a break to work with some Python in CS212 course in Udacity (Design of Computer Programs). Today worked through some lessons only so for the coding of the day I worked as well on katas in codewars

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

In CS212 course, worked on some coding for a poker game. 

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

Coding in Python. Discovered and practiced some functions within the itertools module. Finished lesson 1 in CS212. Also dove into JavaScript: went through several FCC challenges. So far it's pretty similar to Python.

### Day 14: January 16, 2017

Almost finished all basic JavaScript and OOP challenges in FCC (82 in a row! :s) before starting some algorithm scripting, looking forward to actual open exercises. JavaScrcipt is now to me between Python and, more closely, Java. Will it be easy to make small mistakes because of it since my Java is not yet fluent?

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

Quickly finished JS/OOP challenges and started the basic algorithms ie short independent exercises to solve on my own. They're quite fun and entertaining. I've seem some of them in the past so the task is more that of remembering and translating, a good exercise in another way.

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

Did quite some more basic algorithms, some quite tricky. Also visited codewars and practiced some katas in Python.

### Day 17: January 19, 2017

Again some more algorithms. Hoped to finish them all but might leave a couple for tomorrow. Should move on to the CS212 course (self-imposed deadline this sunday!). No extra time today.

### Day 18: January 20, 2017

Intense day today working with Python. Did most of lesson 2 from the CS212 course in Udacity, quite advanced coding so really inspiring, only the problem sets to finish now. Learning a lot from this course, read a bit about idioms and techniques, best practices.

### Day 19: January 21, 2017

Short day: only had time to get my mind blown by the solutions to some problems in CS212 course (I'm definitely not good enough!) and did the challenges for JSON APIs and AJAX.

### Day 20: January 22, 2017

Starting to read about, investigate and set up the Random quote machine project in FCC.

### Day 21: January 23, 2017

Built a skeleton of my randm quote site and then tried to understand APIs: what are they, how can I find one to use for free and how to make it work (and the extra challeges of codepen). Taking quite some time!

### Day 22: January 24, 2017

Trying to find a way to still use an API for the random quote page.

### Day 23: January 25, 2017

Working on the random quote page. Really getting mad because the FCC lessons didn't explain anything compared to what I'm seeing in other people's codes. Yes, I kind of gave up trying to find out by myself how it works and searched for other random quote sites to see how they're built. I noticed, surprisingly, that most of them (in codepen) don't call an API but hardcoded the quotes in a JS object. Still, difficult to see how I could have coded that with the knowledge I have of JS at this point (from FCC and random search online) - impossible.

### Day 24: February 04, 2017

Yes, I admit I took some days off... The reason is rather silly, but I actually got frustrated with my random quote project. Couldn't make the call to the API work and I still don't know why, so I got frustrated and stopped. Mistake: didn't switch to something else. Today I'm picking up again where I left off (against the rules of the challenge, I'm aware!) with some challenges in FCC. Trying the beta version with renewed curriculum and seems quite more logical, at least for the first part.

### Day 25: February 05, 2017

Started/finished the course on how to build a website from Codecademy. Trying to start again easy after the break so what's better than to consolidate bases?

### Day 26: February 06, 2017

Following the same path as yesterday, started the Codecademy course on HTML/CSS (part I), did 4 units (42%) out of 9. I find that they present concepts in a cleaner way than in FCC - maybe with the new FCC curriculum that will change? The comments seems to point there.

### Day 27: February 07, 2017

Finished course on HTML/CSS from codecademy. Definitely liked the way they organise and present the concepts. The opportunity is there to see the concepts live and play with them while learning. It was a good move that helped me clarify and organise what I knew and also expand some concepts.

### Day 28: February 08 2017

Worked on reformulating the random quote webpage. Started by using a piece of code with the JS call to API found online, which worked where mine didn't. Had spent several days trying to find out how to do but I think at this point it's beyobnd my knowledge (so far only did the challenges on FCC on API and they're way not enough, I have hopes that with the new curriculum that'll improve, or maybe we are not supposed to do very well on this project yet and ressort to hardcoding the quotes). Eitherway, my quotes page is not perfect, but works, so I'll leave it as it is for now.

### Day 29: February 09, 2017

Updating github with changes. Resumed FCC challenges: intermediate algorithm scripting.

### Day 30: February 10-12, 2017

Could not put a decent coding session in during these days, but managed to do alltogether a couple of FCC intermediate algorithms and some reading. With the idea of improving and practicing my javascript skills, I also made the decision to try the #javascript30 course by Wes Bos. Not sure what level it'll have, supposedly intermediate, but not sure I'm there yet. We'll see - signed up and will start tomorrow.

### Day 31: February 13, 2017

Started #javascript30! Mmmm It's definitely beyond my level at this point. However, I like the course, the way it's organised and taught. I am also motivated to improve, so I'll stick to it and follow the course at my own pace. Practice, practice, practice! I think though that I'll need some "lower-level" practice to alternate with (that'll help consolidate bases) so I don't burn out ;)

### Day 32: February 14, 2017

Been mainly looking at javascript resources: followed a short course/tutorial (1.5h) that ended up being too basic for me and started another longer one that is for now a good one: starts with the basics but extends to so much further, allowing me to practice in parallel. Did already some longer coding as exercises that met my daily goal. Will continue with this course in parallel to #javascript30 and FCC.

### Day 33: February 15, 2017

Practiced objects and arrays in JS, still within yesterday's course (in Udemy). I confirm it helps improving my knowledge, many small things I didn't realise come into place. Feeling positive.

### Day 34: February 20, 2017

After some days without computer and barely 20 minutes on the best of days, I managed to start/complete the JavaScript course on SoloLearn (via ipad). Last module's theory on DOM, event handlers and animations was actually new to me.

### Day 35: February 21, 2017

JavaScript30 first lesson: drum kit. Implemented step by step the vanilla JS explained during the exercise and later played a bit with the css. I understood much better the JS code now than a few days ago when I attempted it for the first time (yay!). Also learned about template literals, which I'd never used before. All in all a very fruitful day so far. Later read as well about list comprehensions, practiced filter, map and reduce functions.

### Day 36: February 22, 2017

Practiced JS arrays: forEach, slice, filter, concat, indexOf... Cracked a FCC algorithm I'd been stuck with for a while.

### Day 37: February 23, 2017

Went through the Object Oriented Programming section of the JS Udemy course I'm following. It seems rather confusing at first sight - there are quite some differences between JS and say Python, the language I know the best - so I'll be sure to go through it again and practice some more.

### Day 38: February 24, 2017

Practiced some more. JS exercises from the Udemy course, section on OOP. Rechecked the lessons.

### Day 39: February 27, 2017

After a pause because of, well, family life, I came back to doing a couple of freecodecamp (FCC) algorithms. More challenging than I thought, I'll admit, and I'm not sure my solutions are the most efficient but they work nicely. Should check out the FCC wiki as well.

### Day 40: February 28, 2017

Went back to the Udemy course on JS and now only some final exercises left to finish. Last part was interesting: included the DOM, browser events, event objects, how browsers work, an intro to AJAX, error handling and debugging. This course gave me a pretty solid base on JS, not bad at all.

### Day 41: March 01, 2017

Started with the course-end exercises from the Udemy JS course. I never imagined it would be difficult to apply the latest concepts into actual code (I was building a simple slideshow), but I was wrong! Got stuck with a couple things but I'm actually glad about that and the fact that with practice I'll get better and better. Feeling positive. 

### Day 42: March 14, 2017

So after several days of no actual coding (only reading) I'm jumping back in. Joined a javascript mini bootcamp organised by LambdaSchool for that. First day today, was pretty basic but a warming up for me at this point nonetheless.

### Day 43: March 15, 2017

Day 2 of the JS mini bootcamp. For loops, arrays... I'd also done it all, but they did go over git/github as well, which was useful. Practiced some more.

### Day 44: March 16, 2017

Day 3 of the JS mini bootcamp. Creating and manipulating objects, great practice with the exercises!

### Day 45: March 17, 2017

Day 4 & final of the JS mini bootcamp. Advanced JS including callback functions, constructors, prototype, closures, recursion. Great practice, learned a lot! Wish there were more of today's exercises.

### Day 46: March 18, 2017

Started a promissing course on watchandcode.com titled practical javascript. Starting off good! Although it only covered topics I already knew so far, the instructor has a very interesting way to teach, from an example, that makes it all so much more intuitive. I find it completes/clarifies my understanding of the concept nicely.

### Day 47: March 19, 2017

Second day of practical javascript course. Could not dedicate much time to it today but we're reaching the advanced topics so I'm eager.

### Day 48: March 20, 2017

Finished the practical javascript course of watchandcode.com. It is definitely one of the best (if not the best) free courses I've done so far on JavaScript. I enjoyed it very much and learned a lot too. Must keep the momentum!

### Day 49: March 21, 2017

Used some time to plan the next steps in self-learning. Dove once again into javascript30, will try to go through 2 or 3 and see if a detour is still needed. Today re-visited the drum kit and the CSS + JS clock and went through JS cardio 1. Reeeally fast pace, not sure these videos are helping me more than they're making me anxious.

### Day 50: March 23, 2017

Diving into the You Don't Know JavaScript books. Coming from my search for guidance in my self-learning adventure: thinking of following this learning path https://goo.gl/48pluH or/and maybe this other longer one https://goo.gl/O70niK 

### Day 51: March 24, 2017

YDKJS books: finished 1 Up & Going

### Day 52: March 25, 2017

YDKJS books: on 2: scope & closures

### Day 53: March 26, 2017

Read a bit of YDKJS book scope & closures. Then did a (very big) jump to CS50: started lesson 0... the way the class is delivered is so grand I feel like I took a flight to the States. Towards the end it gets better, nice idea for an introduction to programming that of playing with Scratch. Overall though the course's difficulty level does seem to increase pretty quickly - let's see!

### Day 54: March 27, 2017

Spent most of the coding time in Scratch, building a project for CS50. It's quite entertaiting I must admit, although it does eat a lot of your time if you're not careful! (My advice would be to have a solid idea of what you'll be building, maybe even a sketch or notes in paper, so that you stay focused and don't end up investigating 10 different options before deciding what to build).

### Day 55: March 28, 2017

Finalised and submitted the CS50 Scratch project. Revisited and uploaded some code done for a todo app in Github. Before bed ended up reading some more chapters of YDKJS.

### Day 56: March 29, 2017

Very little time today and had to submit a problem set for the 6.00.2x MIT edX class on Python (my second running of the course). It's been several weeks I don't code/read Python and haven't been working on advanced algorithms either, so it took some effort. It's rather scary to see how quickly you can be out of practice...

### Day 57: March 31, 2017

I did some reading yesterday as well as obsessing over the CS50x puzzles (Puzzle Day 2017 event), so I didn't count the day as a coding day for this challenge.
Today I finished the book Scope & Closures from the YDKJS series. There're a couple of concepts that I'll need some more studying for, but otherwise I'm happy with the pace of the book and I can follow well. A bit of practice is lacking, to my mind, but for now I want to go through them once first. The two concepts that were more difficult for me to grasp were: a) the lexical-this behaviour, via arrow functions or via the bind() method (both of which I hadn't yet seen or practiced before), and b) modules and closures. I'll need to re-read about that.

### Day 58: April 11, 2017

To sum up the last few days: the puzzle day went by and got to solve 2 of the 8 puzzles (yay me!...), read a bit more, mostly articles and blogs, and also decided to concentrate on web development for now, so I put on hold a couple courses (python and java) I had going on at the same time and signed up to a bootcamp I read good things about (tackles front-end, back-end and databases, in Udemy).
So a couple days ago I already started this course, even if I'm only counting days from today on for the #100DaysOfCode challenge (the beginning covered only basics and not much coding). Today finished sections 3/4 for html with several coding exercises.


### Day 59: April 12, 2017

Tackled another two sections of the bootcamp, this time for css. Practiced with selectors, built a basic tic tac toe board and a basic photo blog grid. Final project on this section to be built tomorrow.

### Day 60: April 13, 2017

Finished the bootcamp section on CSS by building a blog from scratch. Only html and css for now, but I'm quite happy with the result. I also refactored the random quote machine project, so far html/css, following what I've been practicing these last days.

### Day 61: April 14, 2017

Did a bit of reading (notably CSS selectors and their efficiency https://goo.gl/cCKeXL), watched some videos, started the bootcamp's section on bootstrap and applied some of those features to refactor my portfolio page.
I'm wondering if it's actually a good idea (for newbies like me) to mix bootstrap with plain css at this stage? First time I learned CSS/bootstrap I certainly did find it confusing.

### Day 62: May 15, 2017

Yes, a month passed! I should be counting this as day 1 all over again, but I'm not sure I'd be motivated enough to continue the challenge. I plan on continuing learning for a long while still though. Today I came back to the web dev bootcamp in Udemy (Steele) to finish the bootstrap lesson I left in the middle of. Practiced creating a couple simple sites (code along style) which I pushed to github.

### Day 63: May 16, 2017

Starting JavaScript on the bootcamp. Went through most basics today (4 units), mostly as a reminder and practice so fast-forwarded a bit. Looking forward to all the units still ahead!

### Day 64: May 17, 2017

Continued work with the bootcamp, on to JS objects.

### Day 65: May 18, 2017

Continued work with the bootcamp, started DOM manipulation. Liked the teaching, concepts seem very clear to me so far.

### Day 66: May 19, 2017

Worked on a color guessing game which, for the first time, mixes a fairly good level of HTML, CSS and JS in the same project. A bit intimidating at the beginning but it's so interesting to see how the teach codes piece by piece. I've tried to come up with ways to solve most features by myself before actually watching how the teach did it, and I'm excited to see I was not too far off sometimes.

### Day 67: May 20, 2017

Finished the color game. I'm thrilled, even if after all it was a code-along. The key: small steps, one feature at a time.

### Day 68: May 21, 2017

Had very few time but still read some articles online.

### Day 69: May 22, 2017

Spent this one day (some 6 hours?) cloning a webpage from scratch using bootstrap. It's a rather simple blog type page with a navigation bar, text, image and header. This challenge came from homework day 2 of lambda school's mini bootcamp on basic html/css/js currently ongoing. A good exercise for practice, despite its aparent simplicity not all features were that easy for me yet...

### Day 70: May 23, 2017

Learning jQuery. Very good explanation from Colt (Udemy's bootcamp), particularly about the differences between jQuery and plain JS as well as the whys of using one or the other. Highly recommend it. Did some coding practice along with the class.

### Day 71: May 24, 2017

Finished the todo list page (code along with the bootcamp). Made a point to try to code each of the features before watching the teacher's explanations and some wored very well. Good exercise. We used jQuery, html and css. Also started the YDKJS book on 'this' and prototypes.

### Day 72: May 25, 2017

Back to reading a bit of YDKJS.

### Day 73: May 26, 2017

Worked on refactoring my simple random quotes app. I lack design ideas! Need to finish the tweet button which for now doesn't work properly.

### Day 74: May 27, 2017

Left the random quotes app aside for now, lining up new steps/projects. Some reading.

### Day 75: June 2, 2017

Created a simple version of the animation game at http://www.patatap.com/ using paper.js and howler.js to create the shapes, sounds and animations.

### Day 76: June 3-4, 2017

Counting both days as one, since the first was maybe only an hour worth of work. Started with backend, intro to the concepts, http requests, a reminder of the CLI commands, node.js and npm, installed my first packages and tried a few things, set up a cloud 9 account to start with (pretty great!). Tomorrow more!

### Day 77: June 5, 2017

Learned about express.js and created my very first express app! Pretty excited so far with the possibilities.

### Day 78: June 7, 2017

Getting ready for the chingu cohorts starting this weekend. Yay!!

### Day 79: June 9, 2017

Worked on refactoring my very first page, a tribute page built last January. It's quite interesting to see some of my very obviously messy code. Also spent some time with the cohort group, introductions are so interesting, so many different people put together. It's promissing!

### Day 80: June 10, 2017

Went through the webdev bootcamp's lectures. Practiced with express and starting learning about APIs.

### Day 81: June 11, 2017

Went through the APIs lesson in the webdev bootcamp. Helpful, although the API the instructor used seemed quite simple. Later researched about APIs and more concretely about how to include their use in my random quote project. I'm stuck! Tried a few things but I can't seem to make it work. Perhaps I am choosing the wrong API, because what I tried to do is avoid using jQuery - is that even possible?

### Day 82: June 12, 2017

Started the final project (YelpCamp) in Udemy's WebDev bootcamp. Set up the app, installed packages, set up templates and partials and used bootstrap to style most of the templates. There're still so many other lessons working on this project... I'm looking forward to see what we do! Next: learning about databases. Apart from that, I also watched a couple of conferences on webdev topics online.

### Day 83: June 14, 2017

Started learning about databases in the web dev bootcamp. Code-along type of lessons, a lot of new concepts, difficult, but very interesting. Installed and practiced with MongoDB and learned about Mongoose.

### Day 84: June 15, 2017

Started again book 1 of YDKJS: Up & Going, as part of a challenge with the chingu cohort. After discussion about how to go about this challenge, we decided to read book 1 by Saturday and do a coding session together. Also found out about a technique for memorization with a software called Anki (flashcards type). 

### Day 85: June 16, 2017

Finished reading YDKJS book 1 and creating my Anki cards for revision. Will probably be most useful for me than the group, specially since some of them are not very well built (too much info, long, words are not optimized...). Started a new challenge with the cohort: one kata a day (CodeWars) - solved the first one.

### Day 86: June 17, 2017

Did some more web dev bootcamp lessons and started creating a RESTful blog app.

### Day 87: June 19, 2017

Finished the creation of a RESTful blog app with web dev bootcamp. Very good exercise, liked it. I plan on building another restful app myself, must find topic.
